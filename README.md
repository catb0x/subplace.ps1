subplace.ps1 lets you join some subplaces on roblox ^_^
download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catb0x/subplace.ps1/refs/heads/main/subplace.ps1)

## usage
after downloading, go to the foilder where its downloaded (or where u move it) and open the file w powershell,,, u can cd into the folder n run it like .\subplace from an admin window but if u open it it will open a new powershell window w admin. when selecting to join a subplace enter either the main place id or a subplace id. if u choose the former it will show all subplaces n u can copy paste the one u wanna join but if u choose the latter it will open it for you. idk if it works w/o bloxstrap so its recommended but it might. if it doesnt work just try it again
